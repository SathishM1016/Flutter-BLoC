# Flutter-BLoC


## This repositry contains the projects that are done by me using BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern .

If you people wondering and don't know what exactly BLoC pattern is here is your solution 

*Its a state management system for Flutter recommended by Google developers. 
*It helps in managing state and make access to data from a central place in your project.

Yah! it's that simple ..

But you have to learn and implement and show the world what you are doing 

# Learn - Practice - Fail - Learn
